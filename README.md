Official Website of an imaginary INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATION inspired by Real IO , V.I.G.I.L "Voice for International Guardianship & Institutional Liberty." is an independent international watchdog dedicated to safeguarding human rights and upholding the 2006 Convention against Enforced Disappearance. We aim to provide a transparent digital platform that monitors global institutional liberty and ensures accessible humanitarian data for all.
Help Wanted: Improving the V.I.G.I.L. Digital Experience

I have built the initial foundation for The Vigil Project website using HTML and CSS, but I am looking for collaborators to help refine the code and elevate the user experience. As a humanitarian initiative focused on transparency and data access, it is critical that our platform is responsive, accessible, and intuitive for users worldwide.

I am specifically looking for help with:

UI/UX Refinement: Modernizing the design to feel more like an established international organization (clean, authoritative, easy to read).

Responsiveness: Ensuring the layout works perfectly on mobile devices and tablets.

Code Optimization: Cleaning up the existing HTML/CSS structure for better performance.

Accessibility: Improving navigation for users with disabilities (ARIA labels, contrast, etc.).
